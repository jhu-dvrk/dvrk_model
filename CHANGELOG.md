Change log
==========

2.3.0 (2024-08-31)
==================

* API changes:
  * New repository based on old dvrk-ros but only includes dvrk_model part.  For previous releases, see archived repository `dvrk-ros` (https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/dvrk-ros).
  * Supports ROS1 and ROS1
* Deprecated features:
  * None
* New features:
  * URDF and launch files for surgeon console as well as Classic and Si patient carts
* Bug fixes:
  * Plenty but the URDF files should still not be trusted as most of the physical DH parameters have been guestimated

2.2.1 (2023-12-29)
==================

* API changes:
  * Add `deinterlace` for gscam launch for DeckLink cards
* Deprecated features:
  * None
* New features:
  * Added `-s` to publish raw voltages for SUJs
* Bug fixes:
  * None

2.2.0 (2023-11-21)
==================

* API changes:
  * :warning: All topics `measured_cp` and `setpoint_cp` use `PoseStamped` instead of `TransformStamped`
  * `video.md` and video launch files moved to newly created `dvrk_video` package (still part of this repository)
* New features:
  * Support for Si PSMs, ECM and SUJ
  * All video related files (launch and md) moved to ROS package `dvrk_video` to avoid build dependencies on the full dVRK stack
  * Added `vcs` files (replacing `wstool`) for dVRK 2.1, 2.2 and devel
  * Added command line options to expose more IO and PID topics
  * `dvrk_console_json` can locate `ros-io-<arm>.json` files using internal path, no need to specify the full path
  * All Python examples updated to use newly introduced `crtk.ral` (ROS Abstraction Layer) and `crtk.check_connections`
  * Added `dvrk_reset_teleoperation.py` to reposition MTMs and PSMs to better position between teleoperation tasks, very useful for user studies!
  * `dvrk_bag_replay.py`: can now replay using `setpoint_jp` or `setpoint_cp`, fixed timing, doesn't use full `dvrk.psm` but creates a light class using `crtk.utils`, record and send joint velocities for better trajectory following
* Bug fixes:
  * Many

2.1.0 (2021-08-10)
==================

* API changes:
  * Potentiometer ROS topics use joint state messages

  * None
* Deprecated features:
  * None
* New features:
  * dvrk_robot:
    * Add tf2 support
    * Multiple threads used, one for publishers, one for tf2 and one for subscribers.  This reduces latency on all subscribers
    * Publishes interval statistics for IO component as well as ROS bridges
    * SUJ joint state subscriber when in simulation mode
    * Added psm `set_effort_jaw` subscriber

1.5.0 (2017-11-07)
==================

* API changes:
  * dvrk_robot:
    * Update to match new arm state machine
    * Joint commands are now using joints for kinematics only.  On PSM, jaw is not the last joint anymore, it has its separate topics
    * PSM jaw and MTM gripper now use joint state to report position/velocity/effort
    * Better support for console/footpedals events
  * Python:
    * Added blocking/non blocking flag for move commands using trajectory generation
  * Matlab:
    * Added flag to send direct move commands (vs. trajectory goals)
    * Removed all callbacks since these tended to block the interpreter, now use getters to get latest value received.  Getters return timestamp as well.
    * Added ecm.m, console.m and teleop_psm.m
    * Code factorization for all conversion methods
  * Models/URDF:
    * PSM now subscribes to joint state for jaw to control last joint

1.4.0 (2016-08-31)
==================

    * Import as a package using `import dvrk`
    * Added base class arm.py with common features as well as mtm.py, ecm.py, psm.py for arm specific topics
    * Added wrappers console.py, suj.py and psm-teleop.py for corresponding ROS topics
  * Matlab:
    * API more closely matches Python interface
    * Use with CAUTION, it works fine in interactive mode but in a script, Matlab tends to never call the ROS spin function and the callbacks are failing.  See more comments in the dvrk_matlab readme.md
* Deprecated features:
  * Message types have changed to take adavantage of Stamped data type (mostly for timestamps).  See compatibility mode in new features.
  * dvrk_kinematics, dvrk_teleop and rqt_dvrk are now deprecated, still available in directory `deprecated`
* New features:
  * dvrk_robot:
    * Added many topics to match more closely the C++ available commands (see dVRK API wiki page)
    * Added compatibility mode to maintain old topic names and message types.  For example, `dvrk_console_json` has the option `--compatibility <value> : compatibility mode, e.g. "v1_3_0", "v1_4_0" (optional)`
* Bug fixes:
  * Better timestamps (cisst-ros new feature)

1.3.0 (2016-01-08)
==================

* API changes:
  * Python: now import as a package using `import dvrk_python.robot`

  * Updated al urdf code to handle arm name as parameter (e.g. PSM1, PSM2)
* Deprecated features:
  * None
* New features:
  * dvrk_python/src/robot.py can be used a a simple Python API hiding all the ROS topics/data types
